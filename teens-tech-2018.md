### Background

The Teens and Tech survey was administered in 2018. Click

to access the data and view published reports from Pew Research.

### Demographics

First, I want to take a look at who the survey respondents are. Let’s
start with gender:

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ##   GENDER     n percent
    ##   <chr>  <int>   <dbl>
    ## 1 female   395    53.2
    ## 2 male     348    46.8

There are slightly fewer female respondents than male - the difference
is slightly more pronounced than I expected it to be. Besides gender, I
am unable to deduce any of the other demogrpahic variable coding
schemes. I’ll have to continue exploring, or maybe I could request a
detailed codebook.
